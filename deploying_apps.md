# Deploying and integrating Node.js apps
{: #deploy_apps-nodejs}

You can deploy your Node.js apps with a toolchain or by using the command-line interface. A toolchain is a set of tool integrations. The command-line interface is a simple way to deploy your apps and service instances.

For more information, see [Deploying apps](/docs/apps?topic=creating-apps-deploying-apps).

## Developing serverless Node.js apps
{: #serverless-nodejs}

To facilitate serverless development, you can use the IBM Functions as a Service (FaaS) offering, {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}}. {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} enables application logic to be run in response to events or direct invocations from web or mobile apps over HTTP without provisioning or managing servers.

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} performs system administration like auto-scaling, availability management, and maintenance, allowing developers to remain focused on writing application logic.

For more information, see [Developing serverless apps](/docs/apps/deploying?topic=creating-apps-serverless).

## Integrating back-end services with a generated SDK
{: #backend_gensdk}

The {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} SDK Generator plug-in easily integrates back-end services to your app with a generated SDK. When a change to a REST API occurs, you can regenerate the SDK and replace the old one for a seamless SDK upgrade. You can also integrate the CLI into a DevOps pipeline and ensure that the SDK is always consistent with the API spec each time the app is built.

For more information, see [Integrating back-end services with a generated SDK](/docs/swift/backend?topic=swift-sdkgen-cli).

## Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster
{: #deploy_kube}

You can learn how to use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service to deploy a containerized Node.js app that uses Watson Tone Analyzer. In provided scenario, a fictional PR firm uses the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service to analyze their press releases and receive feedback on the tone of their messages. For more information, see the tutorial [Deploying apps into Kubernetes clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_apps_tutorial).

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry
{: #node-deploy-cf}

This option deploys your cloud-native app without you needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.

If you plan to deploy your app to [{{site.data.keyword.cfee_full}}](/docs/cloud-foundry?topic=cloud-foundry-about), you must [prepare your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/cloud-foundry?topic=cloud-foundry-prepare).

If your account has access to {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}}, you can select a deployer type of either **[Public Cloud](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-about-cf)** or **[Enterprise Environment](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-cfee)**, which you can use to create and manage isolated environments for hosting Cloud Foundry applications exclusively for your enterprise.

## Deploying to a Virtual Server
{: #virtual_deploy}

A virtual service delivers a higher degree of transparency, predictability, and automation for all workload types. Terraform is used for building, changing, and versioning your infrastructure safely and efficiently.

  VSI deployment is available for some starter kits. To use this feature, go to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard](https://{DomainName}), and click **Create an app** in the **Apps** tile.
